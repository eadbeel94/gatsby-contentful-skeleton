# Gatsby + Contentful Skeleton

## Quick start

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    npm install
    npm run develop
    ```

2.  **Open the code and start customizing!**

    Your site is now running at http://localhost:8088!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8088/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

## Other helpful scripts

- `npm run build` -- Compile application and make it ready for deployment
- `npm run clean` -- Wipe out the cache (.cache folder) and public directories
- `npm run serve` -- Serve the production build of your site for testing
